# ⭐ Hi, I'm Tayná!

## 🚀 About Me
An entrepreneur by nature, I've journeyed through diverse realms, from photography to t-shirt retail and screen printing, even venturing into the healthy food business. Alongside, I discovered stability and passion in Digital Marketing, serving as a Paid Traffic Manager and Social Media Specialist since 2019.

Programming entered my life in 2021, thanks to my programmer husband who introduced me to Python, confident I would enjoy it – and he was right 😂. Initially, I dove into studying, but soon other priorities took precedence, pausing my learning journey. In 2022, the need to develop a website for a personal project reignited my interest, leading me to resume my studies and delve into the fascinating world of Programming. Around this time, driven by my ongoing interest, I also began studying System Analysis and Development at university.

Currently, I'm focusing on Web Development, but my university studies and insatiable curiosity keep me expanding my knowledge beyond this niche.
