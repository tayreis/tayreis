# ⭐ Hi, I'm Tayná!

## 🚀 About Me
An entrepreneur by nature, I've journeyed through diverse realms, from photography to t-shirt retail and screen printing, even venturing into the healthy food business. Alongside, I discovered stability and passion in Digital Marketing, serving as a Paid Traffic Manager and Social Media Specialist since 2019.

Programming entered my life in 2021, thanks to my programmer husband who introduced me to Python, confident I would enjoy it – and he was right 😂. Initially, I dove into studying, but soon other priorities took precedence, pausing my learning journey. In 2022, the need to develop a website for a personal project reignited my interest, leading me to resume my studies and delve into the fascinating world of Programming. Around this time, driven by my ongoing interest, I also began studying System Analysis and Development at university.

Currently, I'm focusing on Web Development, but my university studies and insatiable curiosity keep me expanding my knowledge beyond this niche.

The key focus of this project was to ensure high responsiveness and to break away from the conventional long-scrolling format typically seen in landing pages. By prioritizing a concise and user-friendly design, the landing page offers an engaging and efficient user experience, tailored to effectively showcase the eBook and its benefits to potential customers.
