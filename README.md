💻 **Frontend Developer** | 🎯 **Digital Strategist** | 🚀 **Tech-Driven Creator**

I bridge **creativity and code** — blending marketing vision with front-end development to build intuitive, high-impact digital experiences.  

🌱 Started in digital marketing (2019), discovered coding in 2023, and never looked back.  
Now I focus on crafting clean interfaces, scalable architectures, and meaningful user journeys.
